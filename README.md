Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)

The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference.
This was in response to the "Software Crisis," where large-scale software systems became too complex, leading to failures, cost overruns, and delays.
The conference emphasized structured programming, better software design practices, and systematic development methodologies.
The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s)

In the 1970s, structured programming was introduced to improve software readability, maintainability, and error reduction.
Languages like Pascal, C, and Ada gained popularity, encouraging modular code and better program flow control.
Waterfall Model was introduced by Winston Royce (1970), formalizing software development into sequential stages: requirements, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
The Agile Revolution (2001-Present)

In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced, emphasizing flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development over rigid planning.
Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP) replaced traditional waterfall approaches, making software development more adaptive.
This shift led to the rise of DevOps (Development + Operations), automation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), significantly improving software delivery speed and reliability.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis

In this phase, project stakeholders define and document software requirements.
Business needs, user expectations, and system functionalities are gathered and analyzed.
Output: Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
Planning

Project scope, cost estimation, timelines, and resource allocation are determined.
Risks are assessed, and a development strategy is established.
Output: Project plan and feasibility analysis.
Design

The software architecture, user interface (UI), database structure, and overall system design are created.
High-Level Design (HLD) defines system structure, while Low-Level Design (LLD) focuses on module-level details.
Output: Design documents and prototypes.
Implementation (Coding)

Developers write the actual code based on the design documents.
Programming languages and frameworks are chosen depending on project requirements.
Output: Executable software modules.
Testing

The software is tested for bugs, errors, and functionality issues.
Types of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Output: Bug reports and test case results.
Deployment

The software is deployed to production or released to end-users.
Deployment may be done in phases (e.g., beta release) or all at once.
Output: Live working software.
Maintenance

After deployment, ongoing support, updates, and bug fixes are provided.
Enhancements and modifications are made based on user feedback.
Output: Updated and optimized software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next, while Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing changes throughout development. Waterfall requires extensive documentation upfront, ensuring all requirements are well-defined, while Agile focuses more on working software with minimal documentation. In Waterfall, customer involvement is limited after the initial requirements phase, while Agile involves continuous customer feedback throughout the project. Waterfall is better suited for projects with stable requirements, while Agile is ideal for projects where requirements may change frequently. Testing in Waterfall occurs at the end of development, while Agile integrates continuous testing into each iteration.

Appropriate Scenarios
Waterfall: Best for government or regulatory projects where requirements are fixed, and detailed documentation is necessary.
Agile: Suitable for mobile app development, where user feedback can shape new features and improvements over time.
